# LevelUp Legends
LevelUp Legends is a full-stack (React / Django / PostgreSQL) application for videogame enthusiasts using the RAWG.io videogame API. It uses session-based authentication and protects against Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The user is able to register, login, view top games and search for games they enjoy. It implements infinite scroll functionality for improved user experience. Users can also access a game detail page that shows a carousel of images from the game, a description, genres, rating, platforms the game is available on, and the date when it became available on that platform.
